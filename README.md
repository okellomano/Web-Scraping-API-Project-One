# Web-Scraping-API-Project-One
In this project, we are using Python requests to scrap data from ebooks.com web API.

This is a Jupyter notebook project that shows how to scrape data from ebooks.com using Python and Pandas. The scraped data is saved in an Excel file.

### Getting Started
To run this project, you will need Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. You can download and install Jupyter Notebook from the official website: https://jupyter.org/install

Once you have Jupyter Notebook installed, download or clone this repository to your local machine.  Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook to see the project.

### Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries installed:
<ul>
  <li>requests</li>
  <li>pandas</li>
</ul>

You can install these libraries using pip, by running the following command in your terminal:
pip install requests pandas

### Running the project
To run the project, open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook. Run each cell in the notebook to see the project in action.

The notebook is divided into sections that show the different steps of the web scraping process. Each section contains explanations and comments to help you understand the code.

Once the project is completed, an Excel file named books.xlsx will be saved in the same directory as the notebook. This file will contain the scraped data.

Note: The project as implemented now will only scrap data from the first page of the URL used.
